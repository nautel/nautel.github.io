Hi, I'm Tuan!

I'm a PhD Student in Machine Learning Applications at the Univeristy of Technology of Compiegne.

My research interests are in computer vision and anomaly detection.

I'm also interested in philosophy. My favorite scholars are [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) and [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha).
