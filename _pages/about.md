I'm a PhD Student in Machine Learning Applications.

My PhD research topic is about Deep Learning Based-models for Anomaly Detection in Industry 4.0.

I'm interested in philosophy. My favorite scholars are [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) and [Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha).
