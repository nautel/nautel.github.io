## 👋 **Hello there, I'm Tuan!**

### 🎓 About Me
👨‍💻 I'm a **PhD Student in Applied Machine Learning** at the **University of Technology of Compiègne**, diving deep into the fascinating world of AI and its real-world applications.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; color: white; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
  <h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">🔬 Research Focus</h4>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">My research interests center around <strong>anomaly detection</strong> and <strong>computer vision</strong> - helping machines understand what's normal and spot the extraordinary!</p>
</div>

### 🧠 Beyond Research
📚 When I'm not training neural networks, I explore the depths of human thought through philosophy. My intellectual companions include:
- 💭 **[Friedrich Nietzsche](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)** - The philosopher of will and creativity
- 🧘 **[Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha)** - The teacher of mindfulness and wisdom

  💡 <em>"The intersection of ancient wisdom and modern AI fascinates me - both seek to understand patterns in the complexity of existence."</em>

## 🌟 **A bit more about me**

### Why I love what I do
Honestly, I've always been drawn to challenges that seem a bit crazy at first. Whether it's trying to make sense of messy time-series data or exploring French cities by bicycle, I get excited about problems that require you to think differently and stick with them for the long haul.

My research journey started with practical questions - how do we make Vietnam's power grid more efficient? But it's evolved into something deeper: can we build AI systems that actually understand the world the way humans do? That's what drives me every morning, whether I'm debugging a neural network or heading out for a training run.

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #43e97b 0%, #38f9d7 100%); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; color: white; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">🏃‍♂️ How sports keeps me grounded</h4>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">People sometimes ask how I balance research with marathon training and cycling around France. The truth is, they feed each other. When I'm stuck on a particularly stubborn algorithm, cycling to a new French city often helps me see the problem from a new angle.</p>
</div>

The patience I've learned from endurance sports - knowing that progress comes in small, consistent steps - has been invaluable when working on multi-year research projects. I'm currently training for my first **Ironman**, which feels like the perfect metaphor for PhD research: it's long, sometimes painful, but incredibly rewarding when you push through the tough moments.

### 🎯 What I'm looking for
I want to work with people who are genuinely curious about building AI that matters. I thrive in environments where we can have honest conversations about hard problems, where failure is seen as part of the learning process, and where the goal is always to create something that makes a real difference.

<div style="background: #fff8e1; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #ffa726; margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
  🚀 <strong>I believe the best research happens when you combine technical rigor with a genuine sense of adventure - both in the lab and on the road.</strong>
