## 👋 **Hello there, I'm Tuan!**

### 🎓 About Me
👨‍💻 I'm a **PhD Student in Applied Machine Learning** at the **University of Technology of Compiègne**, originally from **Vietnam** 🇻🇳. My journey from electrical engineering in Danang to AI research in France has been shaped by curiosity, adventure, and a deep belief that technology should serve humanity.

**🌏 My Background:**
- **Born and raised** in Vietnam, where I first fell in love with solving complex engineering problems
- **Studied Electrical Engineering** at Danang University, focusing on power systems and optimization
- **Moved to France** in 2021 to pursue my PhD - a leap of faith that changed everything
- **Fluent in Vietnamese, English, and learning French** (though my French cycling vocabulary is much better than my academic French! 😅)

  <h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">🔬 Research Focus</h4>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">My research interests center around <strong>anomaly detection</strong> and <strong>computer vision</strong> - helping machines understand what's normal and spot the extraordinary! I'm particularly excited about making AI systems more robust and interpretable for real-world applications.</p>

**🏠 Life in France:**
Living in Compiègne has been an incredible adventure. I've discovered that French cities are perfect for cycling exploration, and each weekend brings new routes and hidden gems. The transition from tropical Vietnam to European seasons has been... educational! ❄️🌸

### 🧠 Beyond Research
📚 When I'm not training neural networks, I explore the depths of human thought through philosophy. My intellectual companions include:
- 💭 **[Friedrich Nietzsche](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)** - The philosopher of will and creativity
- 🧘 **[Gautama Buddha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buddha)** - The teacher of mindfulness and wisdom

  💡 <em>"The intersection of ancient wisdom and modern AI fascinates me - both seek to understand patterns in the complexity of existence."</em>

## 🌟 **A bit more about me**

### Why I love what I do
Honestly, I've always been drawn to challenges that seem a bit crazy at first. Whether it's trying to make sense of messy time-series data or exploring French cities by bicycle, I get excited about problems that require you to think differently and stick with them for the long haul.

**🔄 My Research Evolution:**
My research journey started with practical questions - how do we make Vietnam's power grid more efficient? Working with **Vietnam Electricity** taught me that the most impactful solutions often come from understanding both the technical complexity and the human needs behind them.

But it's evolved into something deeper: can we build AI systems that actually understand the world the way humans do? This question keeps me up at night (in a good way!) and drives me every morning, whether I'm debugging a neural network or heading out for a training run.

**💡 What Fascinates Me Daily:**
- **The poetry in algorithms** - There's something beautiful about elegant code that solves complex problems
- **Cross-cultural perspectives** - My Vietnamese background brings a unique lens to European research approaches  
- **The intersection of theory and practice** - I love research that has real-world impact
- **Learning from failure** - My best insights often come from experiments that didn't work as expected

<div style="background: linear-gradient(135deg, #43e97b 0%, #38f9d7 100%); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; color: white; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <h4 style="color: white; margin-top: 0;">🏃‍♂️ How sports keeps me grounded</h4>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">People sometimes ask how I balance research with marathon training and cycling around France. The truth is, they feed each other. When I'm stuck on a particularly stubborn algorithm, cycling to a new French city often helps me see the problem from a new angle.</p>
</div>

The patience I've learned from endurance sports - knowing that progress comes in small, consistent steps - has been invaluable when working on multi-year research projects. I'm currently training for my first **Ironman**, which feels like the perfect metaphor for PhD research: it's long, sometimes painful, but incredibly rewarding when you push through the tough moments.

**🚴‍♂️ My Athletic Journey:**
- **Running**: Started with 5Ks in Vietnam, now training for marathons in France
- **Cycling**: From city commuting to weekend adventures exploring the French countryside  
- **Swimming**: The newest addition to my routine (and the most humbling!)
- **Triathlon**: Recently completed my first sprint distance in Chantilly - photo evidence above! 📸

**🌍 Adventures Beyond the Lab:**
- **Weekend city hopping** by bike across Northern France
- **Food exploration** - mastering the art of finding the perfect post-ride café
- **Language learning** through sports communities (surprisingly effective!)
- **Photography** during training rides (because Instagram doesn't update itself! 📱)

### 🎯 What I'm looking for
I want to work with people who are genuinely curious about building AI that matters. I thrive in environments where we can have honest conversations about hard problems, where failure is seen as part of the learning process, and where the goal is always to create something that makes a real difference.

**🤝 My Ideal Collaborators:**
- **Curious minds** who ask "what if?" more than "why not?"
- **Cross-disciplinary thinkers** - some of my best ideas come from unexpected conversations
- **People who value both precision and creativity** 
- **Teams that celebrate small wins** while working toward big goals
- **Mentors and mentees** - I learn as much from teaching as from being taught

**🌟 Personal Values:**
- **Authenticity over perfection** - I'd rather work with genuine people than polished facades
- **Impact over prestige** - solving real problems matters more than impressive titles
- **Growth mindset** - every challenge is a learning opportunity
- **Cultural curiosity** - diversity of thought makes everything better
- **Work-life integration** - my best research happens when I'm living fully

<div style="background: #fff8e1; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #ffa726; margin: 1rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
  🚀 <strong>I believe the best research happens when you combine technical rigor with a genuine sense of adventure - both in the lab and on the road.</strong>
