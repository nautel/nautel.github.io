I am thrilled to share that my latest research article, "Unsupervised detecting anomalies in multivariate time series by Robust Convolutional LSTM Encoderâ€“Decoder (RCLED)," has been published in Neurocomputing Journal! ðŸ“šðŸ§ 

In this study, we use robust deep-learning techniques to address the crucial anomaly detection task in modern industrial systems. Our proposed RCLED model leverages convolutional, LSTM, and self-attention layers to extract complex features from multivariate time series data. Additionally, we introduce a novel training technique inspired by robust principal component analysis to handle noisy input data effectively. We evaluated RCLED on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art models, particularly in high noise-level scenarios.
